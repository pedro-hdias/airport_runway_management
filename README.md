# airport_runway_management

This project is a simple system to allow manage an airport runway, controlling the aircrafts that need to take off.

## The problem is

I need to do a college assignment, and I'm working on it in Python. This is the project:

Let's assist an airport that has a large number of takeoffs per day. We need to help operators, airlines, agencies, and passengers check the information of planes that are about to take off.
Our role will be to develop a data structure algorithm in Python. This algorithm should manage the control of the airplane takeoff runway at this airport, focusing on ensuring data control and providing better information to people. Therefore, our algorithm should include the following items:

1. Allow the takeoff of the first plane in the queue.
2. Add a plane to the takeoff queue.
3. c) Show the total number of planes waiting in the takeoff queue.
4. List all planes in the takeoff queue.
5. List the characteristics of the next plane to take off (the plane at the front of the queue).
6. Show the position of a plane based on its flight number.

**Note:** Each plane should be represented by a class in Python and contain the plane model, airline company, origin, destination, number of passengers, and flight number.
